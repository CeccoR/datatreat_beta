# Backlog

Things looked at and deliberately left for later. Each says what was found and what
was proposed; nothing here is in the code yet.

## GC

- **CSV fields in quotes.** `splitCSVLine` splits on the delimiter even inside quotes,
  so a comma-separated export with quoted comma decimals (`"0,5089"`) shifts the
  columns: H₂ reads 0 and O₂ takes the next column. Semicolon files with comma
  decimals are fine. Proposed: split on delimiters outside quotes only.
- **Impossible dates.** `parseGCDate` takes month/day/year and does not check the
  ranges: `13/10/2025` silently becomes 10 Jan 2026, `2/30/2025` 2 Mar. Proposed:
  refuse a date that does not exist (or detect day/month order from the file).

- **Replicates.** A way to say that several datasets are the same sample, so the
  mean rate gets real statistics (mean ± spread over replicates) instead of an
  error estimated from one run. Until then the mean rate is reported as it is.

## XRPD

- **Kα1/Kα2 separation without fitting, through the standard.** The classic FWHM is
  measured on the unresolved Kα1+Kα2 doublet, whose splitting grows with angle
  (0.06° at 25°, 0.22° at 75°). With a standard chosen, separate the two "easily"
  (no profile fit — e.g. a Rachinger-type stripping, or the doublet width the
  standard shows at each angle) so the sample's Kα1 width is what is sized. Without
  a standard nothing says how the width varies: no Caglioti can be invented, and
  nothing is done.
- **Peak assignment across samples (crystallite size by peak).** Peaks are matched
  in one greedy sweep in order of 2θ: each joins the current reflection if its
  sample is not in it yet and it lies within √(w² + w̄²) of the reflection's mean
  position (w its FWHM, w̄ the reflection's mean FWHM), else it starts a new one. It
  is order-dependent and compares against the mean only, so two reflections closer
  than about one FWHM can swap peaks. To be solved: e.g. an optimal assignment
  (each sample's peaks to the reflections at minimum total distance in sigmas)
  rather than the sweep.
- **Free shape: the axes held on the lattice (found in v429; its case gone in v430).**
  Two defects of the shape search, measured on 36D and 37D without texture and on
  synthetic discs, with the Sr site held full. (1) A body held on the lattice goes to the
  simplest direction within 10° of the free fit's axis, not the nearest: discs whose free
  normal lies within 0–2° of [310] are reported as "⟨210⟩ (8°)", and the held box and
  ellipsoid of 36D stay on [210], 2–10 in χ² above the same solids held on [310]. Taking
  the nearest direction needs a preference for the simpler one when χ² is practically
  equal (a synthetic [210] disc as a box would otherwise be held on [320], 0.6 lower).
  (2) The held candidates are built only near the best free fit: frames on the low-index
  directions (⟨100⟩, ⟨110⟩, ⟨111⟩) are never tried. v430 found what had sent those discs
  to [310]: the Sr site of these samples scatters 0.63–0.74 of a full one, and with the
  occupancy refined the disc's normal is ⟨110⟩ on all twelve samples, 0–3° off — the
  lamellae the samples are made of. The two defects remain as rules, with no real case
  that needs them now; worth doing only if another sample shows them.
- **A broad component under the SrTiO₃ patterns (found in v430).** On the user's twelve
  samples a hump at 29–31° (FWHM 5–7°, 14–37 % of the (110)'s area) lies under the
  pattern, larger the lower the refined Sr occupancy (r −0.89): a disordered, Sr-poor
  part, perhaps the lamellae's surface. The Chebyshev background takes it up only in
  part, and pulled up at 22.7° it takes the weak (100) with it. Proposed: an amorphous
  term in the background (a pseudo-Voigt hump, position and width refined), offered as a
  setting; with it a free-area fit moved (100) from 0–0.2 to 0.2–0.7 of the model.
- **The Ni filter's continuum (found in v430; tried in v432, not kept).** Between the Ni K
  edge (1.488 Å) and Cu Kα₁ the filter passes the tube's continuum: on LaB6_real a step
  under every line, 0.7 per Å of the line's intensity (2–3 % of its area), on its
  low-angle side. The engine draws Kα₁ and Kα₂ only. Tried as a band of wavelengths every
  0.0004 Å from the edge to Kα₁ (and to 1.60 Å), its density fixed at 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 per
  Å: χ²_ν 4.37 → 4.17 at best (worse above), the first and last lines unchanged, and the
  2–4 % excess on the low side of the lines at 40–90° still there. Not the standard's
  misfit; worth trying again with its density refined and the band's shape (the tube's
  spectrum through the filter) once the rest fits.
- **The standard's profile: what else was tried (v432).** The user's LaB6 fitted at χ²_ν
  4.37 (FCJ), its (100) and (110) at 185 and 114 in their windows and its last line 15 %
  short at its top. v432 took it to 2.17 with the Soller model and a sin 2θ shift
  (RIETVELD.md §3.5, §3.7.1). Tried on the way, in a copy of the engine, and not kept
  (χ²_ν of the whole LaB6, with FCJ unless said; last line's window from 24.5):
  - Kα2 with its own Lorentzian width (×1.1–1.35 of Kα1's X; the doublets fitted one by
    one above 100° want 1.09–1.18, as the lines' natural widths differ): 4.35–4.47, last
    line 23.8–22.7.
  - The whole Cu Kα spectrum (Berger's five Lorentzians, TOPAS's CuKa5, each its width):
    4.34–4.55, last line 21–22.
  - The flat sample's aberration (the fixed ½° slit; 1/√ over −α²cotθ/2): 4.86 and 5.45
    (½° and 0.7°): worse.
  - U and W free to go negative: 4.72, worse (W went negative and the Gaussian to its
    floor).
  - A Gaussian term in cot²θ (the X'Celerator's strips off the focusing circle, its 2.122°
    active length): beside the Soller model 2.23 → 2.21, the term refined to 1.1·10⁻⁵ °²
    against the geometry's 1.3·10⁻⁵; real but too small to keep.
  What is left: the (100)'s window at χ²_ν 37, the last line's top 10 % short. Next to try:
  the Sollers' opening refined (0.05 rad gave 2.06), the Ni continuum refined (above),
  the shape of the Cu Kα lines on top of the Soller model.
- **Rietveld against MAUD (started in v426, on hold).** How far our engine and MAUD
  recover a known truth from synthetic patterns at equal model depth, with a third,
  neutral generator (the Debye scattering equation of atomistic crystallites), to
  guide the calibrations. Done so far, outside the repository: MAUD 3.06 built from
  source and run headless; a model-by-model map with the conversions (MAUD draws a
  Lorentzian sample breadth with √π where π is due, so its Delft sizes and fault
  probabilities need a factor; its log-normal "Distributions" counts the size twice;
  its Warren faults shift no line; it has no free shape, so solids are compared by
  their column lengths along a few directions); runners for both programs, ours also
  with forward differences as MAUD's, and 32 cases; the Debye generator, its checks
  unfinished. Two engine problems it found: a fault probability carried the starting
  cell's error (α·a_start/a_true), fixed in v427 with the calibrations; autoRefine's
  anisotropic-strain stage ended in a wrong minimum on a ZnO case (D 34 nm for 50, a
  strain clipped to 0) that refine() from the same start recovers, to be checked again
  on v427's stages.

## EPR

- **Baseline.** Drawn through the first and last raw points only, so a noisy end
  tilts it. Being reworked by the user; left as it is meanwhile.
